# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the R2 File Explorer's authentication and credential management system. The current implementation stores unencrypted R2 credentials in Cloudflare KV storage and performs only basic format validation without testing credentials against the R2 API. This enhancement will implement comprehensive security improvements prioritized by risk level, including credential encryption, proper validation, rate limiting, and additional security hardening measures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Credential Encryption in KV Storage

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my R2 credentials to be encrypted when stored on the server, so that my sensitive access keys cannot be compromised if the storage system is breached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN R2 credentials are stored in KV THEN the system SHALL encrypt the credentials using AES-256-GCM encryption
2. WHEN retrieving credentials from KV THEN the system SHALL decrypt the credentials before use
3. WHEN encryption fails THEN the system SHALL reject the login attempt and log the error
4. WHEN decryption fails THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and require re-authentication
5. IF the encryption key is not available THEN the system SHALL fail securely and not store credentials

### Requirement 2: Actual Credential Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to verify that my R2 credentials actually work before accepting them, so that I don't get authenticated with invalid credentials that will fail during file operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits R2 credentials THEN the system SHALL test the credentials against the actual R2 API
2. WHEN credential validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with session creation
3. WHEN credential validation fails THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error with appropriate message
4. WHEN R2 API is unreachable THEN the system SHALL return a service unavailable error
5. IF validation takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and return an error

### Requirement 3: Login Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want login attempts to be rate-limited, so that attackers cannot perform brute force attacks against user credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes login attempts THEN the system SHALL track attempts per IP address
2. WHEN login attempts exceed 5 failures in 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL block further attempts from that IP
3. WHEN a blocked IP attempts login THEN the system SHALL return a rate limit error
4. WHEN the rate limit window expires THEN the system SHALL allow login attempts again
5. IF a successful login occurs THEN the system SHALL reset the failure count for that IP

### Requirement 4: JWT Secret Rotation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want JWT signing secrets to be rotatable, so that compromised secrets can be invalidated and replaced without system downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL support multiple JWT secrets for validation
2. WHEN a new JWT secret is added THEN existing tokens SHALL remain valid during transition
3. WHEN JWT secrets are rotated THEN the system SHALL use the newest secret for signing
4. WHEN validating tokens THEN the system SHALL try all active secrets until one succeeds
5. IF no secrets can validate a token THEN the system SHALL reject the authentication

### Requirement 5: Session Timeout Implementation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my sessions to have absolute timeouts regardless of activity, so that abandoned sessions cannot be exploited indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL set both sliding and absolute expiration times
2. WHEN a session reaches its absolute timeout THEN the system SHALL invalidate it regardless of recent activity
3. WHEN a session is used within the sliding window THEN the system SHALL extend the sliding expiration
4. WHEN a session exceeds either timeout THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. IF session cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue operation

### Requirement 6: Credential Scoping and Minimal Permissions

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to store only the minimum required permissions for my R2 access, so that the impact of a security breach is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are validated THEN the system SHALL determine the minimum required R2 permissions
2. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL store only the validated permissions scope
3. WHEN performing R2 operations THEN the system SHALL verify operations are within the stored scope
4. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL return an authorization error
5. IF permission validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Audit Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all authentication and security events to be logged, so that I can monitor for suspicious activity and investigate security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log them with timestamp, IP, and outcome
2. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the blocked attempt details
3. WHEN credential validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason (without exposing credentials)
4. WHEN sessions are created or destroyed THEN the system SHALL log the session lifecycle events
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation but alert administrators

### Requirement 8: Content Security Policy Headers

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to be protected against XSS attacks, so that malicious scripts cannot access my session or perform unauthorized actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving the frontend application THEN the system SHALL include strict CSP headers
2. WHEN CSP violations occur THEN the system SHALL log them for security monitoring
3. WHEN inline scripts are needed THEN the system SHALL use nonces or hashes for approval
4. WHEN external resources are loaded THEN they SHALL be from explicitly allowed domains
5. IF CSP blocks legitimate functionality THEN the policy SHALL be updated to allow it securely

### Requirement 9: Request Signing for API Security

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API requests to be cryptographically signed, so that request tampering and replay attacks are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the client SHALL sign requests with a session-specific key
2. WHEN receiving API requests THEN the server SHALL validate the request signature
3. WHEN signatures are invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an authentication error
4. WHEN request timestamps are too old THEN the system SHALL reject potential replay attacks
5. IF signature validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and increment security metrics

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a web application that provides a familiar File Explorer interface for managing files and folders in a Cloudflare R2 bucket. Users will be able to browse, upload, download, and organize their R2 storage through an intuitive web-based interface similar to traditional desktop file managers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse my R2 bucket contents in a familiar file explorer interface, so that I can easily navigate through my stored files and folders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display the root directory of the R2 bucket
2. WHEN the user clicks on a folder THEN the system SHALL navigate into that folder and display its contents
3. WHEN the user clicks a "back" or "up" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the parent directory
4. WHEN displaying directory contents THEN the system SHALL show file names, sizes, and last modified dates
5. WHEN displaying directory contents THEN the system SHALL distinguish between files and folders with appropriate icons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files to my R2 bucket through the web interface, so that I can add new content without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags and drops files onto the interface THEN the system SHALL upload those files to the current directory
2. WHEN the user clicks an upload button THEN the system SHALL open a file selection dialog
3. WHEN files are being uploaded THEN the system SHALL display upload progress for each file
4. WHEN an upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL refresh the directory view to show the new files
5. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download files from my R2 bucket, so that I can retrieve my stored content locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a file THEN the system SHALL provide an option to download that file
2. WHEN the user selects download THEN the system SHALL initiate the file download to the user's local machine
3. WHEN downloading large files THEN the system SHALL support resumable downloads if the connection is interrupted
4. WHEN a download fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete files and folders from my R2 bucket, so that I can manage my storage space and remove unwanted content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on a file or folder THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with delete option
2. WHEN the user selects delete THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before proceeding
3. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the item from R2 and refresh the view
4. WHEN deleting a folder THEN the system SHALL warn if the folder contains files and require explicit confirmation
5. WHEN a deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message explaining the failure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new folders in my R2 bucket, so that I can organize my files hierarchically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks in empty space THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with "New Folder" option
2. WHEN the user selects "New Folder" THEN the system SHALL prompt for a folder name
3. WHEN the user provides a valid folder name THEN the system SHALL create the folder and refresh the view
4. WHEN the user provides an invalid folder name THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
5. WHEN folder creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to rename files and folders in my R2 bucket, so that I can maintain organized and meaningful names for my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on a file or folder THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with rename option
2. WHEN the user selects rename THEN the system SHALL make the name editable inline
3. WHEN the user provides a new valid name THEN the system SHALL update the item name in R2
4. WHEN the user provides an invalid name THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and revert to original name
5. WHEN renaming fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and revert to original name

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with my Cloudflare account, so that I can securely access my R2 bucket contents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL prompt for Cloudflare API credentials
2. WHEN the user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and store the session securely
3. WHEN the user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an authentication error
4. WHEN the authentication session expires THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate
5. WHEN the user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored credentials and session data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any R2 API operation fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL indicate the connection status and retry options
3. WHEN the R2 bucket is not accessible THEN the system SHALL explain the access issue and suggest solutions
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest waiting before retrying
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log technical details while showing generic user messages

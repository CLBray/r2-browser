# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement the file upload functionality for the R2 File Explorer application. Currently, after authentication, users only see a placeholder message stating that the file explorer functionality will be implemented in subsequent tasks. This feature will enable users to upload files to their R2 bucket through the web interface, supporting both single and multiple file uploads, drag-and-drop functionality, and progress tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files to my R2 bucket through the web interface, so that I can add new content without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags and drops files onto the interface THEN the system SHALL upload those files to the current directory
2. WHEN the user clicks an upload button THEN the system SHALL open a file selection dialog
3. WHEN files are being uploaded THEN the system SHALL display upload progress for each file
4. WHEN an upload completes successfully THEN the system SHALL refresh the directory view to show the new files
5. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload large files to my R2 bucket, so that I can store and manage files of any size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uploads a file larger than 100MB THEN the system SHALL use multipart upload to handle it efficiently
2. WHEN a multipart upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display the overall progress

4. WHEN a multipart upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
5. WHEN a multipart upload completes THEN the system SHALL combine all parts and refresh the directory view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of my uploads, so that I know when they are complete or if there are any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are being uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator for each file
2. WHEN an upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL show the upload speed and estimated time remaining
3. WHEN multiple files are being uploaded THEN the system SHALL display the overall progress and individual file progress
4. WHEN an upload completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user with a success message
5. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to cancel ongoing uploads, so that I can stop transferring files I no longer want to upload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide a cancel button for each file
2. WHEN the user clicks the cancel button THEN the system SHALL stop the upload immediately
3. WHEN a multipart upload is canceled THEN the system SHALL clean up any partial uploads on the server
4. WHEN all uploads are canceled THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the canceled state
5. WHEN an upload is canceled THEN the system SHALL notify the user that the upload was canceled

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files to specific folders in my R2 bucket, so that I can maintain an organized file structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to a specific folder THEN the system SHALL upload files to that folder
2. WHEN the user uploads files THEN the system SHALL maintain the current directory context
3. WHEN the user uploads files to a folder THEN the system SHALL refresh that folder's contents after upload

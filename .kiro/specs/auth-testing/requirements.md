# Authentication Testing Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive testing requirements for the R2 File Explorer authentication system to prevent regressions like the infinite loop issue that was recently fixed. The tests will ensure authentication flows work correctly, session management is robust, and edge cases are properly handled.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AuthContext Integration Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for the AuthContext component so that authentication state management works reliably and doesn't cause infinite loops or other issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AuthContext component mounts THEN it SHALL check for existing sessions only once without creating infinite loops
2. WHEN a valid token exists in localStorage THEN the system SHALL verify it once and set authenticated state
3. WHEN an invalid or expired token exists THEN the system SHALL clear the auth state and remain unauthenticated
4. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL store the token, set authenticated state, and set up refresh timers
5. WHEN logout is called THEN the system SHALL clear all auth state, remove tokens, and clear timers
6. WHEN token refresh is needed THEN the system SHALL refresh the token automatically without user intervention
7. WHEN session verification fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without infinite retries

### Requirement 2: API Client Authentication Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want thorough tests for the API client authentication methods so that all auth-related API calls work correctly and handle errors properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login API is called with valid credentials THEN it SHALL return success with token and user data
2. WHEN login API is called with invalid credentials THEN it SHALL return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN verify API is called with valid token THEN it SHALL return user session data
4. WHEN verify API is called with invalid token THEN it SHALL return validation failure
5. WHEN refresh API is called with valid token THEN it SHALL return new token and expiry
6. WHEN logout API is called THEN it SHALL successfully revoke the session
7. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error messages

### Requirement 3: Authentication Flow Integration Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end authentication flow tests so that the complete user authentication journey works seamlessly from login to logout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the full login flow THEN they SHALL be redirected to the file explorer
2. WHEN a user with existing valid session visits the app THEN they SHALL be automatically authenticated
3. WHEN a user with expired session visits the app THEN they SHALL be redirected to login
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN they SHALL be redirected to login and unable to access protected routes
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all dependent components SHALL update accordingly
6. WHEN session expires during use THEN the user SHALL be gracefully redirected to login
7. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN authentication state SHALL be consistent across tabs

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Edge Case Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling tests so that authentication failures don't crash the application or create poor user experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints return 500 errors THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
2. WHEN network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
3. WHEN localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to session-only authentication
4. WHEN malformed tokens exist THEN the system SHALL clear them and start fresh
5. WHEN concurrent authentication requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without conflicts
6. WHEN component unmounts during auth operations THEN it SHALL clean up properly without memory leaks
7. WHEN rapid successive auth calls are made THEN the system SHALL debounce or queue them appropriately

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests for authentication so that auth operations don't negatively impact application performance or create infinite loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AuthContext mounts THEN it SHALL complete initialization within 100ms
2. WHEN session verification occurs THEN it SHALL complete within 500ms
3. WHEN login is performed THEN it SHALL complete within 2 seconds
4. WHEN useEffect dependencies change THEN they SHALL NOT trigger infinite re-renders
5. WHEN authentication state updates THEN only necessary components SHALL re-render
6. WHEN multiple auth operations run concurrently THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
7. WHEN auth timers are set THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up on component unmount

### Requirement 6: Mock and Test Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test mocks and environment setup so that authentication tests run reliably in isolation without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auth tests run THEN they SHALL use mocked API responses for consistent results
2. WHEN localStorage is tested THEN it SHALL use a mock implementation that can be controlled
3. WHEN timers are tested THEN they SHALL use fake timers for deterministic behavior
4. WHEN network conditions are simulated THEN tests SHALL be able to mock various scenarios
5. WHEN auth state changes THEN test utilities SHALL be able to verify state transitions
6. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN test setup SHALL properly reset all mocks and state
7. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's state

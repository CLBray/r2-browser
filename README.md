## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Wrangler CLI (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- Cloudflare account with R2 and Workers enabled

### Integrated Development Setup (Recommended)

This setup builds the frontend and serves it through the worker, which matches the production environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies for both frontend and worker
cd frontend && npm install && cd ../worker && npm install && cd ..

# Start the integrated development environment
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Build the frontend
2. Start the worker with the frontend assets
3. Serve the application at `http://localhost:8787`

### Separate Development Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run the frontend and worker separately:

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

#### Worker Setup

```bash
cd worker
npm install
wrangler dev
```

The Worker will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

### Configuration

#### Basic Configuration

1. Update `worker/wrangler.toml` with your Cloudflare account details
2. Create R2 bucket and KV namespace in your Cloudflare dashboard
3. Update the binding names in wrangler.toml to match your resources

#### Security Configuration (Required)

The application requires encryption keys for secure credential storage. 

**ðŸ”§ Quick Setup:**
```bash
cd worker
./scripts/setup-secrets.sh
```

**ðŸ“– For complete security setup instructions, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**

This covers:
- Required environment variables (`JWT_SECRET`, `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
- Local development and production configuration
- Key generation and security best practices
- Troubleshooting and emergency procedures

## Development Commands

### Root Project
```bash
npm run dev                    # Build frontend and start worker with frontend assets
npm run build:frontend         # Build frontend only
npm run dev:worker             # Start worker with frontend assets
npm run test                   # Run all tests (frontend and worker)
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev                    # Start standalone frontend development server
npm run build                  # Build for production
npm run preview                # Preview production build
npm run lint                   # Run ESLint
npm test                       # Run frontend tests
```

### Worker
```bash
cd worker
npm install                    # Install dependencies
npm run dev                    # Start standalone worker development server
npm run type-check             # Check TypeScript types
npm test                       # Run worker tests
wrangler deploy                # Deploy to production
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed as a single Cloudflare Worker with static assets serving the React frontend.

### Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build the React frontend
cd frontend
npm run build

# Deploy Worker with static assets
cd ../worker
wrangler deploy --env production
```

### Environment-specific Deployments
```bash
# Deploy to staging
wrangler deploy --env staging

# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy --env production
```

## Authentication

The application requires Cloudflare R2 API credentials:
- Account ID
- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key
- Bucket Name

These credentials are used to authenticate with the R2 API and are not stored permanently.
